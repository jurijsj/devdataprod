Fuel consumption prediction (miles per galon)
--------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------

The application will give you prediction of fuel consumption based on Motor Trend Car Road Tests dataset and linear model.
Run this application by submitting your values such as: 
- Number of cylinders
- Displacement (cu.in.)
- Gross horsepower
- Weight (lb/1000)
- Transmission (auto/manual)

Note: Original dataset contains 10 predictors but after ANOVA test, 4 of them was used: cyl, wt, disp and am. For more information, please check

Motor Trend Car Road Tests
--------------------------------------------------

Description: The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models).
Original dataset contains 10 predictors but after ANOVA test, 4 of them was used: cyl, wt, disp and am. 
- mpg	 Miles/(US) gallon
- cyl	 Number of cylinders
- disp	 Displacement (cu.in.)
- hp	 Gross horsepower
- drat	 Rear axle ratio
- wt	 Weight (lb/1000)
- qsec	 1/4 mile time
- vs	 V/S
- am	 Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
- gear	 Number of forward gears
- carb	 Number of carburetors
